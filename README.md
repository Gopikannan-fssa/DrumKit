# DrumKit

I have developed a Drum Kit project where users can create music by clicking on virtual drum keys. 
This interactive web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each drum key is associated with a specific sound, and when clicked, it triggers the corresponding audio, simulating the experience of playing a real drum kit. This project showcases my web development skills and creativity, offering an engaging and fun musical experience.
